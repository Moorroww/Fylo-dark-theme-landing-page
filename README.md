## My process

### What I learned

Basically.. Tailwind :D
I've learned how Tailwind works, I didn't want to use it before because it looked like a big mess to me, but you get used to it and it speeds things up a lot.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) - This helped me a lot. Very simple and good full of examples docs.
